I try to reflect but I fall in and continue, ever falling inwards, caught in the self reflection fractal, terra firma reversa. I catch myself, I ask "Ok, why am I reflecting?", and I fall right back in, spinning. The answer depends on the answer, and I'm left hanging. When I do manage to mitigate the spin, I find myself the worse for it, for the whole attempt. But I come back again, and again, and again, and one of these days the whole meaning, the whole truth, is going to come pouring out of my thick cracked skull. In the empty aftermath there'll be peace.
      </p>
      <p>
On occasion thoughts flutter up from out of the whirling darkness. One such thought goes "to lose yourself, put your ego to death, realize the happy truth that you do not exist". Yet I'm sitting here with a billion "I"s in 200 words.  I couldn't be further off target. But how could self-reflection proceed without an "I"? Maybe that's the question. And I'm dumped back in, spinning swirling, caught again.
      </p>
      <p>
Show me the mystery goddamnit! I read, write, exercise, code, booze, binge, bone, banter, always looking for the promised land. Nirvana in a beer bottle, Elysian coffee grounds, frauds exposed by glut guts and stained teeth. Immediacy and a moment cashed out as an empty glass and a valediction. The clock strikes midnight and the day is done. Living tomorrow, cranky today. All cranks fear their soul is dead, and that's the truth. Drunks, addicts, and me, a little bit of everything, searching and dying with every moment passed.
      </p>
      <p>
I'm just an interface, a set of actions, a mud ball of interactions. A 3D plane in 4D space tracing out lines, events, hollow inside. A grand declaration, but static and meaningless. A shape in the clouds. In my head there's thoughts and feelings and doubts and wonder, but that's probably just a great illusion. It <em>feels</em> gray bleak black doomed, but it's not. There's a light on in here, I swear it, I know it. I cogito and I feel, I think. But what happens when you destroy yourself to be your best self? One day soon I'll meet mine at high noon, and I guess we'll see who comes back and who's better off. Ego-killing seems a dirty business and I'm not sure I'd prescribe it. I know some genuinely beautiful, happy people. Let them live I say.

      I think I'm as unhealthy as I've ever been. I think I've exercised five times in the last
      three months, zero times since we got Djinn two months ago. I drink almost every day, maybe five
      drinks or so. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I drink three cups of coffee a day and the
      occasional energy drink. I weigh roughly 245 lbs (I'm 5' 11") with
      a body fat percentage pushing 30 (this is a guess). I'm often bloated, short of breath, and
      correspondingly cranky. I've had a couple unsettling days recently involving shortness of breath,
      chest pain, shakiness, et cetera. I'm not even 30 years old. Last week I had a few bouts
      of extreme tiredness, almost like I have diabetes or something. I often find it hard to breath,
      almost like there's not enough room in my abdomen for my lungs, especially after eating. I eat
      taco shop Mexican food four or five times per week and fast food (McDonald's, Carl's Jr, etc) a few
      times per month. I often eat out at slightly less revolting (fast casual?)
      establishments like Chipotle, Subway, Rubio's, Woodstock pizza, etc.
		</p>
    <p>
      So obviously something needs to change. I have too many habits to break all at once though, especially
      if I include habits like video games and trolling Hacker News. I think poor health induces
      poor behavior in some ways, so I'm going to start with changing my diet and exercise patterns. This seems like a pretty
      straight forward good decision. I hope that over the next 30 days I'll be able to break some other  
      bad habits as a side effect of improved health. I feel like I've been living in this weird daze ever since I lived alone in LA. I
      need to break out, or something. Here's the plan:
		</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No eating out. Period. If I go out to a social dinner, I'm only allowed a salad and only if
        not eating would make my company uncomfortable. I'm imagining going out with some of Amber's friends
        or something and not wanting to look like a weirdo for her sake.
      </li>
      <li>
        No energy drinks. Period.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exercise every day. 150 push ups, 150 squats, 50 pull ups, 150 sit ups. 500 reps per day. I'm 
        thinking that it would be cool to, over a longer period of time, increase to 1000 reps per
        day, but I'm also trying not to get ahead of myself.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
       I'll record every day whether or not I succeeded at each of these goals. For the last goal, I'll have
       a slightly loose definition of success because I'm certain that on some days I'll need to give
       my body a chance to recover. I'm not too worried about this looseness because I don't, in general,
       bullshit myself about whether I'm working hard when I'm working out.
     </p>
     <p>
       You know what, let's make this an end-of-year goal, a finish line goal per se. Close out the year strong. In other words,
       instead of doing this for the next 30 days, I'm going to do it for the next ~40 days until New
       Year's Day. And one last thing: in the spirit of a venerable tradition of, and to bestow honor upon, the
       lazy fucks who came before me, I'll start this program <strong>TOMORROW.</strong>

      Oh pretty please<br>
      let me in.<br>
      I swear I'll be<br>
      better when<br><br>

      I come back<br>
      to your school.<br>
      I've been such<br>
      a bloody fool.<br><br>

      I didn't know<br>
      what I had<br>
      'til I'd gone<br>
      and broken bad.<br><br>

      I should've done<br>
      better with<br>
      this glorious,<br>
      most gracious, gift<br><br>

      that you gave<br>
      to me for free<br>
      without a charge<br>
      so willingly.<br><br>

      But I took<br>
      it all in stride<br>
      and never glanced<br>
      around at my<br><br>

      flagging life.<br>
      Even though<br>
      it seems it's<br>
      clear to know<br><br>

      what is right<br>
      and what is dumb,<br>
      now I'm stuck<br>
      with my thumb<br><br>

      up my ass.<br>
      Damn it's so<br>
      awkward and<br>
      uncomfortable.<br><br>

      I hope it's not<br>
      yet too late<br>
      to remedy<br>
      my mistakes.<br><br>

      Oh pretty please<br>
      let me in,<br>
      I'll be better than<br>
      I've ever been.
