    <p>
      I think I'm as unhealthy as I've ever been. I think I've exercised five times in the last
      three months, zero times since we got Djinn two months ago. I drink almost every day, maybe five
      drinks or so. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I drink three cups of coffee a day and the
      occasional energy drink. I weigh roughly 245 lbs (I'm 5' 11") with
      a body fat percentage pushing 30 (this is a guess). I'm often bloated, short of breath, and
      correspondingly cranky. I've had a couple unsettling days recently involving shortness of breath,
      chest pain, shakiness, et cetera. I'm not even 30 years old. Last week I had a few bouts
      of extreme tiredness, almost like I have diabetes or something. I often find it hard to breath,
      almost like there's not enough room in my abdomen for my lungs, especially after eating. I eat
      taco shop Mexican food four or five times per week and fast food (McDonald's, Carl's Jr, etc) a few
      times per month. I often eat out at slightly less revolting (fast casual?)
      establishments like Chipotle, Subway, Rubio's, Woodstock pizza, etc.
		</p>
    <p>
      So obviously something needs to change. I have too many habits to break all at once though, especially
      if I include habits like video games and trolling Hacker News. I think poor health induces
      poor behavior in some ways, so I'm going to start with changing my diet and exercise patterns. This seems like a pretty
      straight forward good decision. I hope that over the next 30 days I'll be able to break some other  
      bad habits as a side effect of improved health. I feel like I've been living in this weird daze ever since I lived alone in LA. I
      need to break out, or something. Here's the plan:
		</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No eating out. Period. If I go out to a social dinner, I'm only allowed a salad and only if
        not eating would make my company uncomfortable. I'm imagining going out with some of Amber's friends
        or something and not wanting to look like a weirdo for her sake.
      </li>
      <li>
        No energy drinks. Period.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exercise every day. 150 push ups, 150 squats, 50 pull ups, 150 sit ups. 500 reps per day. I'm 
        thinking that it would be cool to, over a longer period of time, increase to 1000 reps per
        day, but I'm also trying not to get ahead of myself.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
       I'll record every day whether or not I succeeded at each of these goals. For the last goal, I'll have
       a slightly loose definition of success because I'm certain that on some days I'll need to give
       my body a chance to recover. I'm not too worried about this looseness because I don't, in general,
       bullshit myself about whether I'm working hard when I'm working out.
     </p>
     <p>
       You know what, let's make this an end-of-year goal, a finish line goal per se. Close out the year strong. In other words,
       instead of doing this for the next 30 days, I'm going to do it for the next ~40 days until New
       Year's Day. And one last thing: in the spirit of a venerable tradition of, and to bestow honor upon, the
       lazy fucks who came before me, I'll start this program <strong>TOMORROW.</strong>

      Oh pretty please<br>
      let me in.<br>
      I swear I'll be<br>
      better when<br><br>

      I come back<br>
      to your school.<br>
      I've been such<br>
      a bloody fool.<br><br>

      I didn't know<br>
      what I had<br>
      'til I'd gone<br>
      and broken bad.<br><br>

      I should've done<br>
      better with<br>
      this glorious,<br>
      most gracious, gift<br><br>

      that you gave<br>
      to me for free<br>
      without a charge<br>
      so willingly.<br><br>

      But I took<br>
      it all in stride<br>
      and never glanced<br>
      around at my<br><br>

      flagging life.<br>
      Even though<br>
      it seems it's<br>
      clear to know<br><br>

      what is right<br>
      and what is dumb,<br>
      now I'm stuck<br>
      with my thumb<br><br>

      up my ass.<br>
      Damn it's so<br>
      awkward and<br>
      uncomfortable.<br><br>

      I hope it's not<br>
      yet too late<br>
      to remedy<br>
      my mistakes.<br><br>

      Oh pretty please<br>
      let me in,<br>
      I'll be better than<br>
      I've ever been.
