  <p>
    the first time<br>
    i saw my mom<br>
    when i was drunk<br>
    was an<br>
    interesting experience.<br>
    it was my<br>
    twenty-first birthday.<br>
    i was home<br>
    early<br>
    because i started<br>
    early.<br>
    she was cooking dinner<br>
    for my sister.<br>
    mashed potatoes<br>
    and something else.<br>
    i found that<br>
    i am taller<br>
    than she is.<br>
    i saw her eyes,<br>
    so blue.<br>
    and the lines<br>
    around her mouth<br>
    and her eyes.<br>
    she was cooking<br>
    her dinner<br>
    in her kitchen<br>
    for my sister<br>
    and there were<br>
    lines<br>
    around her mouth<br>
    and her eyes<br>
    and i was drunk.<br>
