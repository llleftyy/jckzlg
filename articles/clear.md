| the first time
| i saw my mom
| when i was drunk
| was an
| interesting experience.
| it was my
| twenty-first birthday.
| i was home
| early
| because i started
| early.
| she was cooking dinner
| for my sister.
| mashed potatoes
| and something else.
| i found that
| i am taller
| than she is.
| i saw her eyes,
| so blue.
| and the lines
| around her mouth
| and her eyes.
| she was cooking
| her dinner
| in her kitchen
| for my sister
| and there were
| lines
| around her mouth
| and her eyes
| and i was drunk.
