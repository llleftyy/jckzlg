| Oh pretty please let me in.
| I swear I'll be better when
| I come back to your school.
| I've been such a bloody fool.
| 
| I didn't know what I had
| 'til I'd gone and broken bad.
| I should've done better with
| this glorious, most gracious, gift
|
| that you gave to me for free
| without a charge so willingly.
| But I took it all in stride
| and never glanced around at my
|
| flagging life. Even though
| it seems it's clear to know
| what is right and what is dumb,
| now I'm stuck with my thumb
|
| up my ass. Damn it's so
| awkward and uncomfortable.
| I hope it's not yet too late
| to remedy my mistakes.
|
| Oh pretty please let me in,
| I'll be better than I've ever been.
