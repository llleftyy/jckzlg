#### the decade in review

The gang broke down

* what they were up to in December 2009
* what went best for cleantech in the 'teens
* what went worst for cleantech in the 'teens
* predictions for the next decade

Each co-host had basically predictable answers to each of these bullets: solar
and wind are the two major victories of the 'teens, business model innovation
and financing are key to driving deployments, and we're not going to meet our
goals unless we push some really radical policy changes. Actually, Jigar thinks
that the unavoidable, physical efficiency of cleantech will drive change regardless
of policy. I tend to agree, cleantech is basically just "well-designed" tech.

The two most interesting pieces of info came from Jigar. He described the "4 Ds"
of infrastructure:

* decentralized
* decarbonized
* digital
* democratized

When he said "infrastructure", I wonder if he meant all infrastructure, or just
energy infrastructure, because you could definitely make a case for these "4 Ds"
in terms of, say, telecommunications and transportation. My guess is he meant all
types of infrastructure.

It's worth noting that "democratized" is less about value distribution and more
about deployment distribution (which does lead to value distribution). Jigar
believes that infrastructure deployment will be handled by increasingly small
organizations down to the municipality level. I sure hope this is the case. I'm
particularly interested in decentralized internet, because _FUCK THE BIG INTERNET
PROVIDERS_.

The other big point Jigar made is that "businesses exist to bring costs down". 
Today, especially in the United States, businesses are seen as (and in fact are)
profit-seekers; when businesses cut costs it's just to increase profits. If 
businesses adopted, in actual practice, the "cost cutting is primary" philosophy,
the world would immediately become a very different place. In that world,
businesses would actually be the agents of progress and evolution that many
claim them to be, for "how can we cut costs of X?" is essentially the same question
as "how can we make some new thing X a reality?".

Stephen mentioned that "nobody actually thought coal was dead in 2009" but that
"today everybody knows coal is dead". I didn't realize how different the sentiment
was in 2009, and it's an interesting instance of how much times have changed over
the last decade.
