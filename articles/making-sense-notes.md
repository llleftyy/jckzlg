#### interview with Judson Brewer
Sam interviewed Judson Brewer, a neuroscientist psychiatrist who runs a treatment
and research center focused on addiction. His work focuses mostly on the 
psychological, behavioral aspects of addiction and how mindfulness practice can
help. He sees deep connections between cravings, reward-based learning, and the
"contraction" into self. Contraction into self is a term from Buddhism, I think,
that attempts to relate certain feelings in terms of the sense of self. In general,
bad feelings are related to an inward-turning closed-off subjective experience
while good feelings tend to be more "expansive" in nature. I intuitively agree
with these notions.

There's a subnetwork in the human brain called the "default mode network" which
is jointly connected to both self-reflection and the "contractive" experiences.
Patients with anxiety disorders tend to have increased activity in the default
mode network. This linking between disorders like anxiety and depression with an
increased focus on the self is, to me, intuitively very promising when it comes
to treatment and understanding. I've noticed that most of the people in my life
who have the most "drama" surrounding them also tend to be the most self-centered.
Reality television is another clear example of the link between self-centeredness
and "drama". 

It's important to distinguish self-centeredness from other qualities like
selfishness. A self-centered person might be extremely generous, loving, caring,
and compassionate. Self-centeredness as I've used it in this context is more 
about how you frame your observations, and so your interpretations, of the world.
Think of how different the world looks from a first person point of view versus
as bird's eye view.

Reward-based learning has the interesting quality that the reward is delivered
earlier and earlier as the learned behavior is increasingly reinforced. This 
helps explain a few things. One is the feeling of an increasingly fleeting high,
of a decreasing ability to experience joy while performing the rewarded behavior.
For example, a food addict would not enjoy a five-star dinner any more than a
non-addict. Another is the slippery-slopiness of many rewarding behaviors. Once you
start to engage in certain rewarding behaviors, it's very difficult to maintain
a consistent level of engagement because your physiology is constantly working
to push you further and further towards what we would classify as addiction.

Judson brewer wrote a book calle _the Craving Mind_ which I will probably read.
I've been worried that certain aspects of Western culture are driving us into
chaos, and I need to start reading more intentionally about this sort of thing.
