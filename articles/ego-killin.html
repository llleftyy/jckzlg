I try to reflect but I fall in and continue, ever falling inwards, caught in the self reflection fractal, terra firma reversa. I catch myself, I ask "Ok, why am I reflecting?", and I fall right back in, spinning. The answer depends on the answer, and I'm left hanging. Once I mitigate the spin, I find myself the worse for it, for the whole attempt. But I come back again, and again, and again, and one of these days the whole meaning, the whole truth, is going to come pouring out of my thick cracked skull. In the empty aftermath there'll be peace.

On occasion thoughts flutter up from out of the whirling darkness. One such thought goes "to lose yourself, put your ego to death, realize the happy truth that you do not exist". Yet I'm sitting here with a billion "I"s in 200 words.  I couldn't be further off target. But how could self-reflection proceed without an "I"? Maybe that's the question. And I'm dumped back in, spinning swirling, caught again.

Show me the mystery goddamnit! I read, write, exercise, code, booze, binge, bone, banter, always looking for the promised land. Nirvana in a beer bottle, Elysian coffee grounds, frauds exposed by glut guts and stained teeth. Immediacy and a moment cashed out as an empty glass and a valediction. The clock strikes midnight and the day is done. Living tomorrow, cranky today. All cranks fear their soul is dead, and that's the truth. Drunks, addicts, and me, a little bit of everything, searching and dying with every moment passed.

I'm just an interface, a set of actions, a mud ball of interactions. A 3D plane in 4D space tracing out lines, events, hollow inside. A grand declaration, but static and meaningless. A shape in the clouds. In my head there's thoughts and feelings and doubts and wonder, but that's probably just a great illusion. It <em>feels</em> gray bleak black doomed, but it's not. There's a light on in here, I swear it, I know it. I cogito and I feel, I think. But what happens when you destroy yourself to be your best self? One day soon I'll meet mine at high noon, and I guess we'll see who comes back and who's better off. Ego-killing seems a dirty business and I'm not sure I'd prescribe it. I know some genuinely beautiful, happy people. Let them live I say.
