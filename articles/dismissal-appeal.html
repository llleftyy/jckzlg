  <p>
    Oh pretty please<br>
    let me in.<br>
    I swear I'll be<br>
    better when<br><br>

    I come back<br>
    to your school.<br>
    I've been such<br>
    a bloody fool.<br><br>

    I didn't know<br>
    what I had<br>
    'til I'd gone<br>
    and broken bad.<br><br>

    I should've done<br>
    better with<br>
    this glorious,<br>
    most gracious, gift<br><br>

    that you gave<br>
    to me for free<br>
    without a charge<br>
    so willingly.<br><br>

    But I took<br>
    it all in stride<br>
    and never glanced<br>
    around at my<br><br>

    flagging life.<br>
    Even though<br>
    it seems it's<br>
    clear to know<br><br>

    what is right<br>
    and what is dumb,<br>
    now I'm stuck<br>
    with my thumb<br><br>

    up my ass.<br>
    Damn it's so<br>
    awkward and<br>
    uncomfortable.<br><br>

    I hope it's not<br>
    yet too late<br>
    to remedy<br>
    my mistakes.<br><br>

    Oh pretty please<br>
    let me in,<br>
    I'll be better than<br>
    I've ever been.
