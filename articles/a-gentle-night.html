    damn it! friend, let's to drink!<br>
    the way i see it i see no other way.<br>
    we'll meet my end and start at bottomed glass<br>
    until i'm cracked and blown out with the wind.<br>
    i'll not go gentle into the night,<br>
    i'll burn and rave and set down with the sun.<br><br>

    together, friends! together: man and son.<br>
    though you're wise, hand me another drink<br>
    for we must not be gentle with the night<br>
    but fork our lightning in this way<br>
    from in the bottle whence we're wined,<br>
    as end comes near as by looking glass.<br><br>

    why, friend, have thine eyes gone looking glass?<br>
    they glint and blaze beneath the sun.<br>
    good man! crying bright tears dried in the wind<br>
    have it out! and have another drink.<br>
    we're together now, later, and alway<br>
    but let us burn and rage 'fore sun sets night.<br><br>

    let's be wild here 'til night!<br>
    let us crash green waves of glass.<br>
    we'll sing the sun who drops below the quay<br>
    and not grieve it's gone, ever still, our sun.<br>
    underneath we'll have this solemn drink<br>
    without old hopes of seeing sun rewind.<br><br>

    now bit-by-bit i've come unwound<br>
    mine blind eyes see not much but night.<br>
    now help me with a gentle drink<br>
    that i'll not crack as shatt'ring glass,<br>
    that blind eyes might blaze here with my son,<br>
    that he should see me burn and rage in my own way.<br><br>

    bless! curse! fierce tears i cast away.<br>
    though it's tough with mortal wound,<br>
    i'd see you clearly, my son, in sun.<br>
    i know you know i'm no white knight,<br>
    you know my shield, 'tis only glass,<br>
    so what to do but have a gentle drink?<br><br>

    with this last gentle drink do send me on my way<br>
    as ash and dust, let glass too scatter with the wind.<br>
    what better dying night than dying with my son?
