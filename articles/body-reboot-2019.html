    I think I'm as unhealthy as I've ever been. I think I've exercised five times in the last
    three months, zero times since we got Djinn two months ago. I drink almost every day, maybe five
    drinks or so. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I drink three cups of coffee a day and the
    occasional energy drink. I weigh roughly 245 lbs (I'm 5' 11") with
    a body fat percentage pushing 30 (this is a guess). I'm often bloated, short of breath, and
    correspondingly cranky. I've had a couple unsettling days recently involving shortness of breath,
    chest pain, shakiness, et cetera. I'm not even 30 years old. Last week I had a few bouts
    of extreme tiredness, almost like I have diabetes or something. I often find it hard to breath,
    almost like there's not enough room in my abdomen for my lungs, especially after eating. I eat
    taco shop Mexican food four or five times per week and fast food (McDonald's, Carl's Jr, etc) a few
    times per month. I often eat out at slightly less revolting (fast casual?)
    establishments like Chipotle, Subway, Rubio's, Woodstock pizza, etc.

    So obviously something needs to change. I have too many habits to break all at once though, especially
    if I include habits like video games and trolling Hacker News. I think poor health induces
    poor behavior in some ways, so I'm going to start with changing my diet and exercise patterns. This seems like a pretty
    straight forward good decision. I hope that over the next 30 days I'll be able to break some other  
    bad habits as a side effect of improved health. I feel like I've been living in this weird daze ever since I lived alone in LA. I
    need to break out, or something. Here's the plan:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      No eating out. Period. If I go out to a social dinner, I'm only allowed a salad and only if
      not eating would make my company uncomfortable. I'm imagining going out with some of Amber's friends
      or something and not wanting to look like a weirdo for her sake.
    </li>
    <li>
      No energy drinks. Period.
    </li>
    <li>
      Exercise every day. 150 push ups, 150 squats, 50 pull ups, 150 sit ups. 500 reps per day. I'm 
      thinking that it would be cool to, over a longer period of time, increase to 1000 reps per
      day, but I'm also trying not to get ahead of myself.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     I'll record every day whether or not I succeeded at each of these goals. For the last goal, I'll have
     a slightly loose definition of success because I'm certain that on some days I'll need to give
     my body a chance to recover. I'm not too worried about this looseness because I don't, in general,
     bullshit myself about whether I'm working hard when I'm working out.
   </p>
   <p>
     You know what, let's make this an end-of-year goal, a finish line goal per se. Close out the year strong. In other words,
     instead of doing this for the next 30 days, I'm going to do it for the next ~40 days until New
     Year's Day. And one last thing: in the spirit of a venerable tradition of, and to bestow honor upon, the
     lazy fucks who came before me, I'll start this program <strong>TOMORROW.</strong>
