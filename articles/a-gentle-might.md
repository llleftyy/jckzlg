| damn it! friend, let's to drink!
| the way i see it i see no other way.
| we'll meet my end and start at bottomed glass
| until i'm cracked and blown out with the wind.
| i'll not go gentle into the night,
| i'll burn and rave and set down with the sun.
| 
| together, friends! together: man and son.
| though you're wise, hand me another drink
| for we must not be gentle with the night
| but fork our lightning in this way
| from in the bottle whence we're wined,
| as end comes near as by looking glass.
| 
| why, friend, have thine eyes gone looking glass?
| they glint and blaze beneath the sun.
| good man! crying bright tears dried in the wind
| have it out! and have another drink.
| we're together now, later, and alway
| but let us burn and rage 'fore sun sets night.
| 
| let's be wild here 'til night!
| let us crash green waves of glass.
| we'll sing the sun who drops below the quay
| and not grieve it's gone, ever still, our sun.
| underneath we'll have this solemn drink
| without old hopes of seeing sun rewind.
| 
| now bit-by-bit i've come unwound
| mine blind eyes see not much but night.
| now help me with a gentle drink
| that i'll not crack as shatt'ring glass,
| that blind eyes might blaze here with my son,
| that he should see me burn and rage in my own way.
| 
| bless! curse! fierce tears i cast away.
| though it's tough with mortal wound,
| i'd see you clearly, my son, in sun.
| i know you know i'm no white knight,
| you know my shield, 'tis only glass,
| so what to do but have a gentle drink?
| 
| with this last gentle drink do send me on my way
| as ash and dust, let glass too scatter with the wind.
| what better dying night than dying with my son?
